> Zmodopipe is a tool that can take the stream from certain model of DVRs and provide that stream through a Named Pipe where programs, including Zoneminder (through `zm_ffmpeg_camera.cpp`) and ffmpeg can read that stream.



This repository is a fork of `zmodopipe` created by [Daniel Osborne (Phoenix84 on ZoneMinder Forums)](https://forums.zoneminder.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=18397). This project has not been updated since 2013, but it was [documented here](https://wiki.zoneminder.com/Zmodopipe)\[1] and [discussed here](https://forums.zoneminder.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=18137)\[2]. 

Daniel put his work in the public domain, and I wanted to make sure it was stored reliably so that it may continue being used. This repository remains in the public domain as well.
